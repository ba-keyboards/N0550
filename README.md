Issues fixed by [Dingusaurus Derp](https://github.com/DingusaurusDerp) with this [fork](https://github.com/DingusaurusDerp/N0550):

- Fixed the mounting points for the case
- Expanded the tolerances for the top so the plate can easily fit
- Expanded the USB cutout so a cable can fit through
- Made space for the controller on the PCB in the bottom case
- Changed the top so the case will only need M3 screws, no heat inserts required (heat inserts still required for the plate mounting points).

### Specs

* Top mount
* 3D printed only, not tested for CNC
