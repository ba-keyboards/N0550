N0550 is a case for [NEC-50](https://github.com/calvin-mcd/NEC-50).

This is a fork of the N0550 made by https://github.com/ba-keyboards

following fixes has been made to the case:

- Fixed the mounting points for the case
- Expanded the tolerances for the top so the plate can easily fit
- Expanded the USB cutout so a cable can fit through
- Made space for the controller on the PCB in the bottom case
- Changed the top so the case will only need M3 screws, no heat inserts required (heat inserts still required for the plate mounting points).
